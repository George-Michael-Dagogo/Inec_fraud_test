However, there has been multiple reports of underage voters, as well duplicate voters (names with more than one Voter ID aassigned to them) having been registered in multiple states.

### Purpose of this Project 
+ This project is centered around scraping a sample or the entire dataset of registered voters from INEC website to identify the duplicate names, and run a basic statstics to know how these errors are distributed across the country.
+ The project focuses on collating the images of the registered voters, transforming them and executing a CNN (Convolution Neural Network) on this data to identify the underage voters as well.
